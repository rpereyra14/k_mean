Goal:

+ To achieve dimensionality reduction of an input image.

Motivation:

+ A cool application of this dimensionality reduction technique is the concept of eigenfaces, where a human face is reduced to a linear combination of a sample of faces. This is a mechanism through which face recognition algorithms work.

Overview:

+ This implementation of the K means algorithm groups pixels from an input image into k-means and outputs an image where pixels have been assigned to one of the k-means.

Usage:

  $     python k_means.py <input_image_file> <number_of_means>
